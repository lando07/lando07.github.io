         <h1>The Rule of Thirds</h1>
         <p>Good composition often results in good photographs, even
            of the most mundane subjects. There are several rules of
            thumb with respect to employing good composition. One of
            the most used is the <em>Rule of Thirds</em>.
            The Rule of Thirds is based on the observation that
            compositions in which the topic of interest is placed directly
            in the center of the frame tend to be static and uninteresting.
         </p>
         <p>A better approach is to imagine a grid drawn over your photograph
            that divides it into thirds, like a tic-tac-toe grid. Place your
            point of interest away from the center of the frame and onto one
            of the intersection points on the grid (see below).
         </p>

            <img src="thirds.jpg" alt="photo" />
         </figure>

         <p>If you place points of interest into the thirds, your photo
            becomes more balanced and will enable the viewer to interact with
            it more naturally. Studies have shown that people's eyes are usually
            drawn to the location of the the intersection points
            in the grid rather than the center of the frame. The Rule of
            Thirds works with this natural way of viewing an image rather than
            against it. Many digital cameras allow the user to display the grid
            on the preview screen, making it easier to employ the Rule of Thirds
            directly before the shot is taken.
