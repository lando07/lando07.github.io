                juggling and circus products, the J-Prop Shop is
                the store for you. I've designed and built props
                for the past 35 years, and my products have been

            <h2>Specials This Month</h2>
            <p>The following devil sticks are available at a
                special discount for the entire month of May:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic Stick ($19.95)
                    The easiest stick to learn with, but “grippy” enough
                    for the most demanding tricks. Comes in red, green,
                    and blue.
                </li>
                <li>Flower Stick ($24.95)
                    A graceful stick with colored tassels. Flower Sticks
                    fl oat slowly, making them ideal for beginners.
                </li>
                <li>Master Stick ($39.95)
                    Our most popular stick is shorter and heavier for
                    fast play and more advanced tricks. Each Master Stick
                    is available in custom colors.
                </li>
                <li>Glow Stick ($29.95)
                    The Glow Stick shines brightly at night (without
                    the danger of a fire stick).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Quality Tested</h2>
            <p>Every item I create is checked and tested before
                being shipped out to assure perfect quality. I take
                pride in every one of my juggling props and I want
                my customers to feel that same pride.

                products. I came upon his work 10 years ago and
                was immediately impressed by his craftsmanship.
                He provides well-balanced and attractive
                props which are the perfect complement to my
                performances.”

            <p>”Dave Vinet makes the best juggling equipment on
                the planet. Period.”
            </p>
            <p>”David has been my main supplier for 20 years. I
                have never had a problem with his equipment and
                his service is impeccable.”
